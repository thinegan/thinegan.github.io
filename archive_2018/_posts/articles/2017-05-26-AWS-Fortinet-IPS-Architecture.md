This reference architecture provides a set of YAML templates for deploying the following AWS services :
- Amazon IAM
- Amazon VPC
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
- Amazon Route53
- Amazon Security Group & NACL

## Prerequisites Notes
The Cloudformation Security Group IP address is open by default (testing purpose). You should update the Security Group Access with your own IP Address to ensure your instances security.

Before you can deploy this process, you need the following:
 - Your AWS account must have one VPC available to be created in the selected region
 - Amazon EC2 key pair
 - Installed Domain in Route 53.
 - Installed Certificate (in your selected region & also one in us-east-1) 

## You can launch this CloudFormation stack in the following Region in your account:
 - US East (N. Virginia)
 - US West (N. California)
 - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
 - Asia Pacific (Singapore)
 - Asia Pacific (Sydney)

The repository consists of a set of nested templates that deploy the following:

 - A tiered [VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html) with public and private subnets, spanning an AWS region.

## Why use AWS CloudFormation with AWS Fortinet?

Using CloudFormation to deploy and manage services with ECS has a number of nice benefits over more traditional methods ([AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli), scripting, etc.). 

#### Infrastructure-as-Code

A template can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to start a new stack).  Templates are simple YAML- or JSON-formatted text files that can be placed under your normal source control mechanisms, stored in private or public locations such as Amazon S3, and exchanged via email. With CloudFormation, you can see exactly which AWS resources make up a stack. You retain full control and have the ability to modify any of the AWS resources created as part of a stack. 

#### Self-documenting 

Fed up with outdated documentation on your infrastructure or environments? Still keep manual documentation of IP ranges, security group rules, etc.?

With CloudFormation, your template becomes your documentation. Want to see exactly what you have deployed? Just look at your template. If you keep it in source control, then you can also look back at exactly which changes were made and by whom.

#### Intelligent updating & rollback

CloudFormation not only handles the initial deployment of your infrastructure and environments, but it can also manage the whole lifecycle, including future updates. During updates, you have fine-grained control and visibility over how changes are applied, using functionality such as [change sets](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-change-sets-for-aws-cloudformation/), [rolling update policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html) and [stack policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html).

After the CloudFormation templates have been deployed, the [stack outputs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/outputs-section-structure.html) contain a link to the load-balanced URLs for each of the deployed microservices.

## How do I...?

### Get started and deploy this into my AWS account

You can launch this CloudFormation stack in your account:

Example using AWS CLI Command :

1. First Download this code into your workstation, make your own changes and make the prerequisites updates.
 - Your AWS account must have one VPC available to be created in the selected region.
 - Create Amazon EC2 key pair
 - Install a domain in Route 53.
 - Install a certificate (in your selected region & also one in us-east-1) 

2. Next install [AWS CLI](aws.amazon.com/cli) in your workstation.

3. Upload all files in the "infrastructure" directory into to your own S3 bucket.

```console
Example :
aws s3 cp --recursive /path_to_template/cloudformation-project2/infrastructure \
s3://cf-templates-19sg5y0d6d084-ap-southeast-1/
	
```

4. You can run the master.yaml file from your workstation.

#### Stage 1 (Deploy VPC and Fortigate Router)
```

--template-body file:////path_to_template//cloudformation-project3//infrastructure//fortinet-webserver.yaml
	
```
### Download Configuration

Here a sample to configuration that you can use [FGTAWS0005616164_20170526_2359.conf](https://github.com/thinegan/cloudformation-project3/blob/master/FGTAWS0005616164_20170526_2359.conf).

### Deploy multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production)

Deploy another CloudFormation stack from the same set of templates to create a new environment. The stack name provided when deploying the stack is prefixed to all taggable resources (e.g., EC2 instances, VPCs, etc.) so you can distinguish the different environment resources in the AWS Management Console. 

### Change the VPC or subnet IP ranges

This set of templates deploys the following network design:

| Item | CIDR Range | Usable IPs | Description |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|:------------|
| VPC | 10.0.0.0/16 | 65,536 | The whole range used for the VPC and all subnets |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|:------------|
| Public Subnet 1 | 10.0.1.0/24 | 251 | The public subnet in the first Availability Zone |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|:------------|
| Private Subnet 2 | 10.0.2.0/24 | 251 | The public subnet in the second Availability Zone |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|:------------|
{: rules="groups"}

| Item | CIDR Range | Usable IPs | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VPC | 10.0.0.0/16 | 65,536 | The whole range used for the VPC and all subnets |
| Public Subnet 1 | 10.0.1.0/24 | 251 | The public subnet in the first Availability Zone |
| Public Subnet 2 | 10.0.2.0/24 | 251 | The private subnet in the first Availability Zone |

You can adjust the following section of the [master.yaml](https://github.com/thinegan/cloudformation-project3/blob/master/master.yaml) template:

```yaml
# Update Domain Name
PMHostedZone:
  Default: "kasturicookies.com"
  Description: "Enter an existing Hosted Zone."
  Type: "String"

# Update Sub-domain and instance type
dev:
  FortigateDomain: "api.kasturicookies.com"
  Webserver1Domain: "dev.kasturicookies.com"
  Webserver2Domain: "devel.kasturicookies.com"
  PMFortinetInstanceType: "m3.medium"

staging:
  FortigateDomain: "staging-fortigate.kasturicookies.com"
  Webserver1Domain: "staging1.kasturicookies.com"
  Webserver2Domain: "staging2.kasturicookies.com"
  PMFortinetInstanceType: "m3.medium"

prod:
  FortigateDomain: "fortigate.kasturicookies.com"
  Webserver1Domain: "www1.kasturicookies.com"
  Webserver2Domain: "www2.kasturicookies.com"
  PMFortinetInstanceType: "c4.large"

# CIDR ranges
MyVPC:
  Type: "AWS::CloudFormation::Stack"
  DependsOn:
  - "MyIAMRole"
  Properties:
    TemplateURL: !Sub "${PMTemplateURL}/fortinet-vpc.yaml"
    TimeoutInMinutes: '5'
    Parameters:
      PMServerEnv: !Ref "AWS::StackName"
      PMVpcCIDR: "10.0.0.0/16"
      PMPublicSubnet1CIDR: "10.0.1.0/24"
      PMPrivateSubnet1CIDR: "10.0.2.0/24"
      PMFlowLogRole: !GetAtt "MyIAMRole.Outputs.VPCFlowLogRoleArn"

```
