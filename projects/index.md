As a Head of IT Infrastructure, I have architected the expansion of AWS server environment, increasing and safe guarding up to 60 servers.
Setup and ensuring information technology security policy are created accordingly and followed through.

Transform the Dev Team into Agile Teamwork. Some of the implementation introduces are such as 
Atlasssian Jira which use Kanban and Scrum. Continuos Integration which automates the build, test and deployment process using Atlasssian Bamboo,

I worked on [**Binary.com**](https://www.binary.com){:target="_blank"}, a provider of fixed-odd financial contracts, as an employee of Regent Markets (the site’s owner) for seven years.
The service has a large user base, and I worked to maintaining the system and bring it forward.

I learned a lot about the dynamics of a system engineering during my time there, from how to have the discipline to writing quality perl code, to the difficulties of managing and keeping over 50 servers secure all around the world.
